## UNDERSTANDING WOOD ORIENTATION & CONNECTIONS

Getting the 2x4 orientation right is key to a strong rack. A standard 2x4 is actually about 1.5 inches thick by 3.5 inches wide. When assembling, pay attention to whether a piece is oriented "on face" (3.5" side visible) or "on edge" (1.5" side visible).

Here's how the pieces fit together:

* **Vertical Uprights (80" pieces):**
    * These stand vertically. In the final rack, they are oriented so their **narrower 1.5" edge faces the front or back**. Their **wider 3.5" face points sideways**, towards the next upright.
    * Horizontal Rails will connect by butting against this **wider 3.5" face**.
    * Top/Bottom Braces will sit on/under the **narrower 1.5" edge** at the top/bottom.

* **Horizontal Rails (30" pieces):**
    * These form the shelf supports. They are oriented **on edge**, meaning their **wider 3.5" face is vertical** (up and down), providing maximum strength for holding weight. Their **narrower 1.5" edge is horizontal**.
    * The **ends** of these rails butt directly against the **wider 3.5" face** of the Vertical Uprights.

* **Top/Bottom Braces (95.5" pieces):**
    * These long pieces connect the uprights lengthwise at the top and bottom. They are oriented **on face**, meaning their **wider 3.5" face is horizontal** (flat), providing stability across the top/bottom of the uprights. Their **narrower 1.5" edge is vertical**.
    * The **ends** of these braces sit on top of (or underneath) the **narrower 1.5" edge** of the Vertical Uprights. You screw through the brace into the end of the upright.

**Key Point:** When assembling, pieces primarily connect by the **end of one piece butting perpendicular** against the **face or edge of another piece**. There isn't a significant "overlap" where the ends of two pieces lie flat on top of each other lengthwise.

## ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Mark the Vertical Uprights
![Marking Diagram](https://storage-rack-guide.example/marking-diagram.jpg)

1. On each 80" upright, mark the following heights from bottom:
   - 1st level: 4" (for top of rails)
   - 2nd level: 21.8"
   - 3rd level: 39.6"
   - 4th level: 57.4"
2. Extend marks around all sides using a level

### STEP 2: Build the First Bay
![First Bay Assembly](https://storage-rack-guide.example/first-bay.jpg)

1. Position two uprights parallel, 23.5" apart (outside measurement)
2. Apply wood glue to rail ends
3. Align first level rails with 4" marks
4. Clamp, drill pilot holes, and secure with screws
5. Check for square and level
6. Repeat for remaining levels

### STEP 3: Add Remaining Bays
![Adding Bays](https://storage-rack-guide.example/adding-bays.jpg)

1. Stand up first bay
2. Position third upright 22" from second (inside measurement)
3. Install rails for second bay, checking level and square
4. Continue adding fourth and fifth uprights to complete all bays

### STEP 4: Attach Braces
![Brace Installation](https://storage-rack-guide.example/brace-installation.jpg)

1. Apply glue to ends of 95.5" braces
2. Position across top of all 5 uprights (front and back)
3. Clamp, drill pilot holes, and secure with screws
4. Repeat for bottom braces

### STEP 5: Install Casters
![Caster Installation](https://storage-rack-guide.example/caster-installation.jpg)

1. Tip rack onto side
2. Position casters near corners
3. Attach using 1/4" lag screws (4 per caster)
4. Place casters with brakes on opposite corners

### STEP 6: Sand and Finish (Optional)
![Finishing](https://storage-rack-guide.example/finishing.jpg)

1. Sand all surfaces (120 grit, then 220 grit)
2. Wipe clean with damp cloth
3. Apply wood sealant or paint if desired
4. Allow to dry completely

## PRO TIPS

![Pro Tips](https://storage-rack-guide.example/pro-tips.jpg)

- **Measure Twice:** Confirm your actual tote dimensions before cutting
- **Use Glue:** Wood glue significantly strengthens all joints
- **Check Square:** Frequently verify 90¬∞ angles during assembly
- **Pilot Holes:** Always pre-drill to prevent splitting
- **Consider Bracing:** Add diagonal braces to the back for extra stability
- **Label Shelves:** Consider adding labels for organized storage

Demonstrating Assembly Flow:

Let's visualize the assembly based on these orientations:

Step 1: You mark your vertical uprights (80" pieces) on all four sides. These will stand vertically in the final structure, oriented with their 1.5" edge facing the front/back.

Step 2 (Building Bays):

Lay two vertical uprights on their side, positioned with their wider face (3.5") facing upwards, parallel to each other, 23.5" apart (outside).

Take your horizontal rails (30" pieces). These will be installed on edge (3.5" dimension vertical).

Apply glue to the ends of the horizontal rails.

Position the ends of the rails against the wider face (3.5") of the uprights at your marked lines. The 30" length of the rail spans the 23.5" gap, with some of the rail end butting against the upright face on each side.

Screw through the upright's wider face (3.5") into the ends of the horizontal rails.

Repeat until you have a completed "bay" which looks like a rectangular ladder frame lying on its side.

Step 3 (Adding Bays):

Stand up your first completed bay frame.

Position a third vertical upright next to the second one. Remember, uprights are oriented with the 1.5" edge front/back.

The distance between the second and third uprights will be 22" (inside measurement).

Now, install the horizontal rails (30" pieces, on edge) between the second and third uprights. Apply glue to the ends of the rails and butt them against the wider face (3.5") of the uprights. Screw through the upright into the rail ends.

Repeat this process, adding the fourth and fifth uprights and the horizontal rails between them until you have five uprights standing parallel, connected by the horizontal rails forming four bays.

Step 4 (Attaching Braces):

Take the long 95.5" braces. These are installed on face (3.5" dimension horizontal).

Apply glue to the ends of the braces.

Place one brace across the tops of all five vertical uprights. The brace will sit on the narrower 1.5" edge of each upright.

Clamp and screw down through the wider face (3.5") of the brace into the narrower 1.5" edge at the top of each upright.

Repeat with another long brace across the bottom of the front, and two more for the back top and bottom. The bottom braces will attach by screwing upwards through the brace's wider face (3.5") into the narrower 1.5" edge at the bottom of each upright.

In Summary of Orientation & Connections:

Vertical Uprights: Stand on 1.5" edge (front/back). Horizontal rails butt against the 3.5" face. Top/Bottom braces sit on the 1.5" edge.

Horizontal Rails: Installed on edge (3.5" dimension vertical). Their ends butt against the 3.5" face of the vertical uprights.

Top/Bottom Braces: Installed on face (3.5" dimension horizontal). Their ends sit on top of (or under) the 1.5" edge of the vertical uprights.

Hopefully, visualizing each piece and its orientation (wide face vs. narrow edge) and then how the ends of one piece meet the side or top/bottom of another helps clarify the assembly process described in the guide. There isn't really an "overlap" of the ends themselves, but rather one piece butting perpendicular into the face or edge of another.
