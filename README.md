2. Apply wood glue to rail ends
3. Align first level rails with 4" marks
4. Clamp, drill pilot holes, and secure with screws
5. Check for square and level
6. Repeat for remaining levels

### STEP 3: Add Remaining Bays

## PRO TIPS

![Pro Tips](https://storage-rack-guide.example/pro-tips.jpg)

- **Measure Twice:** Confirm your actual tote dimensions before cutting
- **Use Glue:** Wood glue significantly strengthens all joints
- **Check Square:** Frequently verify 90¬∞ angles during assembly
- **Pilot Holes:** Always pre-drill to prevent splitting
- **Consider Bracing:** Add diagonal braces to the back for extra stability
- **Label Shelves:** Consider adding labels for organized storage
