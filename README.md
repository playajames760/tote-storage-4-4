## CUTTING DIAGRAM

![Cutting Diagram](https://storage-rack-guide.example/cutting-diagram.jpg)

### Cut List
| Part | Quantity | Length | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Vertical Uprights | 5 | 80" | Main support legs |
| Horizontal Rails | 32 | 30" | Shelf supports for totes |
| Top/Bottom Braces | 4 | 95.5" | Connect uprights for stability |

### Cutting Breakdown

## UNDERSTANDING WOOD ORIENTATION & CONNECTIONS

Getting the 2x4 orientation right is key to a strong rack. A standard 2x4 is actually about 1.5 inches thick by 3.5 inches wide. When assembling, pay attention to whether a piece is oriented "on face" (3.5" side visible) or "on edge" (1.5" side visible).

Here's how the pieces fit together:

* **Vertical Uprights (80" pieces):**
    * These stand vertically. In the final rack, they are oriented so their **narrower 1.5" edge faces the front or back**. Their **wider 3.5" face points sideways**, towards the next upright.
    * Horizontal Rails will connect by butting against this **wider 3.5" face**.
    * Top/Bottom Braces will sit on/under the **narrower 1.5" edge** at the top/bottom.

* **Horizontal Rails (30" pieces):**
    * These form the shelf supports. They are oriented **on edge**, meaning their **wider 3.5" face is vertical** (up and down), providing maximum strength for holding weight. Their **narrower 1.5" edge is horizontal**.
    * The **ends** of these rails butt directly against the **wider 3.5" face** of the Vertical Uprights.

* **Top/Bottom Braces (95.5" pieces):**
    * These long pieces connect the uprights lengthwise at the top and bottom. They are oriented **on face**, meaning their **wider 3.5" face is horizontal** (flat), providing stability across the top/bottom of the uprights. Their **narrower 1.5" edge is vertical**.
    * The **ends** of these braces sit on top of (or underneath) the **narrower 1.5" edge** of the Vertical Uprights. You screw through the brace into the end of the upright.

**Key Point:** When assembling, pieces primarily connect by the **end of one piece butting perpendicular** against the **face or edge of another piece**. There isn't a significant "overlap" where the ends of two pieces lie flat on top of each other lengthwise.

## ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

### STEP 1: Mark the Vertical Uprights
![Marking Diagram](https://storage-rack-guide.example/marking-diagram.jpg)

1. On each 80" upright, mark the following heights from bottom:
   - 1st level: 4" (for top of rails)
   - 2nd level: 21.8"
   - 3rd level: 39.6"
   - 4th level: 57.4"
2. Extend marks around all sides using a level

### STEP 2: Build the First Bay
![First Bay Assembly](https://storage-rack-guide.example/first-bay.jpg)

1. Position two uprights parallel, 23.5" apart (outside measurement)
2. Apply wood glue to rail ends
3. Align first level rails with 4" marks
4. Clamp, drill pilot holes, and secure with screws
5. Check for square and level
6. Repeat for remaining levels

### STEP 3: Add Remaining Bays
![Adding Bays](https://storage-rack-guide.example/adding-bays.jpg)

1. Stand up first bay
2. Position third upright 22" from second (inside measurement)
3. Install rails for second bay, checking level and square
4. Continue adding fourth and fifth uprights to complete all bays

### STEP 4: Attach Braces
![Brace Installation](https://storage-rack-guide.example/brace-installation.jpg)

1. Apply glue to ends of 95.5" braces
2. Position across top of all 5 uprights (front and back)
3. Clamp, drill pilot holes, and secure with screws
4. Repeat for bottom braces

### STEP 5: Install Casters
![Caster Installation](https://storage-rack-guide.example/caster-installation.jpg)

1. Tip rack onto side
2. Position casters near corners
3. Attach using 1/4" lag screws (4 per caster)
4. Place casters with brakes on opposite corners

### STEP 6: Sand and Finish (Optional)
![Finishing](https://storage-rack-guide.example/finishing.jpg)

1. Sand all surfaces (120 grit, then 220 grit)
2. Wipe clean with damp cloth
3. Apply wood sealant or paint if desired
4. Allow to dry completely

## PRO TIPS

![Pro Tips](https://storage-rack-guide.example/pro-tips.jpg)

- **Measure Twice:** Confirm your actual tote dimensions before cutting
- **Use Glue:** Wood glue significantly strengthens all joints
- **Check Square:** Frequently verify 90¬∞ angles during assembly
- **Pilot Holes:** Always pre-drill to prevent splitting
- **Consider Bracing:** Add diagonal braces to the back for extra stability
- **Label Shelves:** Consider adding labels for organized storage
